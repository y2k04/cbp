Chest Boat Patch

- Minecraft version: 1.19.2
- Fabric Loader compatibility: > 0.14.9

## About
I made this mod to fix a problem [ilmango](https://youtube.com/c/ilmango) had when using chest boats as storage. In his Skyblock 1.19 series, he accidentally mounted one of the boats (in [this video](https://youtu.be/h-sr8DV4f4E?t=830)) and caused them to be misaligned. To fix this, I decided to change the interaction behaviour of chest boats. To open the chest boat inventory, you now simply press the use button on it. To ride the boat, you now (by default) press the Left Alt key and the use button.
